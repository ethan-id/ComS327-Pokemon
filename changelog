        Late Start to this project unfortunately, gonna be grinding to finish it by tomorrow night..
        Added pokemonBattle()
            just tells the user when they have encountered a pokemon and gives the manhattan distance
    7:46pm-8:34pm
        Updated parse.cpp & parse.h so that the vectors holding all of the parsed data from the CSV files are globally available within the program.
        Updated pokemon.cpp to parse all files before the game starts running.
    8:40pm-9:07pm
        Pokmeon battles are now triggered 10% of the time the player moves into a tall grass terrain square.
            One of the 1092 pokemon is randomly selected and the message
            "Encountered a *pokemonName!" is displayed
    9:40pm-10:40pm
        While trying to generate a pokemon, noticed for some reason only pokemon.csv is being parsed correctly, other global vectors are not being populated...
    10:41pm-12:05am
        Decided to use the Professor's provided solution for 1.07 instead of mine,
        global arrays of csv data are working as expected.
        Running into some difficulty setting pokemon levels though

    1:36am-2:06am
        Added createPokemon()
        Got levels and other stats to work properly
            Now when a pokemon is encountered a window pops up and displays the pokemon's name and all of it's stats.
    2:07am-2:20am
        Added some funny ascii art cuz why not
    3:50am-4:44am
        Generated pokemon now also have two learned moves
    4:45am-5:30am
        Adding prompt at beginning of game telling player to select their starting pokemon.
            added givePlayerPokemon() and some logic in generateTrainers() to call it once at the start of the program
    5:31am-6:54am
        Added pokemonBattle()
            displays trainer's first pokemon and player's starter
            Trainers don't have any pokemon right now tho so it's just all zeros
    6:54am-7:20am
        Trainers get a pokemon now, just need to add the formula thingy so they have a chance to get up to a max of 6
    3:08pm-3:15pm
        Updated readme in preparation for submission
    3:15pm-3:47pm
        Added 60% chance thing for trainers to gain another pokemon everytime they gain one, up to a max of 6.
        Finished up updating readme and changelog
        Prepping for submission
